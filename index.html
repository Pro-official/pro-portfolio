            <p>We are vikings. Once, we were lived and feared by the whole World. We were fearsome warriors. Odin is our
                allfather. He is the father of the gof Thor. We have defeated England and France more than once. The
                world doesn't beleive us when we say that, "America wasn't found by Colombus. It was discovered by us,

                <h3><span class="different-color">Saved The Seven Realm | created by my ancestors.</span></h3>
                <p>From my childhood, I've knonw the stories about White Walkers but those were just stories. But when I
                    was
                    in Castle Black, I found out that the white walkers are very much real. That's why I have
                    collaborated
                    with the wildlings. I have become the king of the North to ensure the best effort to prevent the
                    White
                    Walkers. Finally, with the help of Dothrakhi, Unsullid, wildlings, Dannyris and the people of the
                    north,
                    I have defeated the White Walkers. </p>

                <h3><span class=" different-color">Ragnar Lothbrok | The most famous viking.</span></h3>
                <p> Ragnar Lothbrok was just a farmer of Kattegat. But his place was not suitable for farming. So, he
                    left
                    home in search of a better place to farm. Eventually, he landed in England. Ragnar was a viking, in
                    his
                    viking life no one is civilian. They didn't understood the concept of military and civilians. So,
                    they
                    just killed every man and woman they found in England and brought back all the valuable things they
                    found. With that, one of the most bloddiest history of Europe began. </p>
